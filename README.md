# Horror Movie Database
Horror movie database is a personal project that I am working on that helps the user to find a great horror movie to watch. It displays a recommended daily movie to watch along with other horror movies that fall into a certain category. The user can click on any movie to watch its trailer or receive more information about that movie. The user can also search for a certain horror movie and favorite a movie to easily find the movie the next time they visit.

This project is still a work in progress but almost completed.

For this project I first wanted to create the site using HTML. I then moved on to adding Javascript to it and lastly adding React.

### Skills:
- React
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Axois
- Responsivenes (layout changes based on size of window)
